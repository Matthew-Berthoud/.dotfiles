# Docker Dev

UNSTABLE: I'm going to change a lot about these to make them more lightweight, so that you develop locally and just run code in them not develop with GNU screen and Vim in them.

I hate installing dependencies locally. With this Docker dev system I can develop everything in Docker containers. I launch containers for them with the following command:

```sh
ddev LANGUAGE
```

Right now I have containers for React, Go, and Python.
